# so_long
so_long is a project where you'll craft your own 2D game using the mlx library from 42school.

The goal of this game is to generate a personalized map from a selected file, gather all collectibles to unlock the exit door, and navigate around enemies to succeed.

1 = Border | 0 = Empty walkable area | C = Coins (collectables) | X = Enemy | E = Exit door | P = Player

The focus of the project is to provide hands-on experience working with textures, sprites, and fundamental graphical components.
Please note that this project is specifically designed for macOS, owing to the use of the MinilibX library. Before starting the project, it's essential to set up this library on your macOS system.
